### Added
- **Agent Discovery** — Injects `x402:store_id`, `x402:gateway_url`, and `x402:context_url` meta tags into `<head>` so AI agents can discover the store and its gateway endpoint.
- **Quote Endpoint** (`POST /wp-json/x402/v1/quote`) — Returns a real-time cart quote including line item totals, tax, and shipping for a given set of SKUs and customer address.
- **Order Creation Endpoint** (`POST /wp-json/x402/v1/order`) — Allows the Armoris gateway to create a WooCommerce order on behalf of an AI agent after payment settlement.
- **Order Status Endpoint** (`GET /wp-json/x402/v1/order/{id}`) — Returns order status, line items, billing/shipping address, and on-chain transaction metadata.
- **Product Catalog Endpoint** (`GET /wp-json/x402/v1/products`) — Exposes product listings (with variation support) for agent-side product browsing.
- **Store Context Endpoint** (`GET /wp-json/x402/v1/context`) — Returns store metadata: name, currency, weight/dimension units, shipping countries, and featured products.
- **Active Currency Endpoint** (`GET /wp-json/x402/v1/active-currency`) — Returns the store's current WooCommerce currency code.
- **Client Secret Authentication** — All write and read endpoints (except `/context`) require a valid `X-402-Client-Secret` HTTP header.
- **Variable Product Support** — Quote endpoint resolves variable product variations using a multi-strategy attribute key matching approach (`attribute_`, `attribute_pa_`, case-insensitive fallback).
- **WooCommerce Payment Gateway** — Registers "Armoris x402 Agent Payment" as a payment method under WooCommerce Settings > Payments, configurable with Store ID and Client Secret.
