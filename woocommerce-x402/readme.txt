Connect your WooCommerce store to the Armoris x402 Agent Payment Gateway, enabling AI agents to autonomously browse, quote, and purchase products using USDC on-chain.

== Description ==

**Armoris x402 Agent Payment** bridges your WooCommerce store with the emerging AI-agent economy. Using the open [x402 protocol](https://x402.org), autonomous AI agents can discover your store, request price quotes, and settle payments directly on-chain — without human checkout friction.

= How it works =

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Connect your store to your [Armoris](https://armoris.io) merchant dashboard.
3. AI agents discover your store via injected meta tags and interact with the x402 REST endpoints to get quotes and create orders.
4. Payments are settled on-chain (USDC,...) and your WooCommerce orders are created automatically.

= Features =

* **Agent Discovery**: Injects `x402:store_id`, `x402:gateway_url`, and `x402:context_url` meta tags into your site's `<head>` for AI agent discovery.
* **Quote Endpoint**: Provides a secure REST endpoint (`POST /wp-json/x402/v1/quote`) so agents can get real-time price quotes including tax and shipping.
* **Automated Order Creation**: REST endpoint (`POST /wp-json/x402/v1/order`) creates WooCommerce orders when payment is confirmed by the gateway.
* **Order Status Lookup**: Agents can check order status via `GET /wp-json/x402/v1/order/{id}`.
* **Product Catalog Access**: Exposes product listings for agent browsing (`GET /wp-json/x402/v1/products`).
* **Store Context**: Provides store metadata (currency, shipping locations, featured products) to AI agents for informed purchasing decisions.
* **Client Secret Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints are protected by a shared secret between your store and the Armoris gateway.
* **Variable Product Support**: Handles variable products with attribute matching for AI agents.

= Requirements =

* WooCommerce 7.0 or higher
* An [Armoris](https://armoris.io) merchant account and Store ID
* PHP 7.4 or higher

== Installation ==

1. Upload/select the `woocommerce-x402` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the Plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in your admin panel.
3. Navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments** and enable **x402 Agent Payment**.
4. Enter your **Store ID** and **Client Secret** from your [Armoris Dashboard](https://armoris.io/dashboard).
5. Set your **Armoris API Gateway URL** (default: `https://api.armoris.io`).
6. Save settings. Your store is now discoverable by AI agents.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an Armoris account? =

Yes. The plugin acts as a bridge between your WooCommerce store and the Armoris x402 gateway. You need a merchant account at [armoris.io](https://armoris.io) to obtain your Store ID and Client Secret.

= Which blockchains and tokens are supported? =

Currently supported networks include SKALE Base Mainnet and Base (Ethereum L2), with USDC as the primary payment token. More networks will be added as the x402 ecosystem grows.

= Is this plugin compatible with other payment gateways? =

Yes. The x402 Agent Payment method coexists with other WooCommerce payment gateways. Human customers can still check out using standard methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

= Does this expose any sensitive data publicly? =

No. Store context metadata (name, currency, shipping locations, featured products) is public by design for agent discovery. All order creation, quote, and product endpoints require a valid Client Secret header (`X-402-Client-Secret`).

= What is the x402 protocol? =

x402 is an open protocol for machine-to-machine payments using HTTP. It extends the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code to enable autonomous agent commerce. See [x402.org](https://x402.org) for more details.
